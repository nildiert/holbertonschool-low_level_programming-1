# Low Level Programming & Algorithms

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions. Generally this refers to either machine code or assembly language. The word "low" refers to the small or nonexistent amount of abstraction between the language and machine language; because of this, low-level languages are sometimes described as being "close to the hardware". 

## About
At Holberton School, there are several tracks to become a full stack software engineer. One of those tracks is the low level programming track which covers the following:

- Compilation process
- Commenting code and following a coding style standard
- Variables, types and logic operators 
- Functions, loops and nested loops
- Pointers, arrays and strings
- Recursion
- Static and Dynamic libraries 
- Argc, argv, and memory management
- Structures, singly and doubly linked lists
- Bit manipulation
- File I/O
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Tables
- Makefiles
- Binary tress
- Sorting and Search Algorithms

## Requirements
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* gcc 4.8.4 (-Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic flags)
